# Chatbot UI

In this project, I've created a simple Chatbot UI, using HTML and CSS which doesn't have any backend functionality.

The prototype that i used to code this was from [figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/fjTNd6rtdZOAL1FGJZkH9m/FDA-Interactions?node-id=1%3A2600&scaling=scale-down-width).

This was an assignment provided by Cogno AI.

To code this I've used HTML and CSS. The animation was also done using CSS. And the final product is hoted at Vercel. This is the [live](https://chatbot-ui-bice.vercel.app/) link to the application.
